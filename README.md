# D-Bank

This is a simple bank application that allows users to create accounts, apply for loans and make payments.

I am using this project to try Next.js for its full stack web application capabilities and to get more familiar with the Vercel platform. This was developed entirely using Next.js and Vercel Postgres.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
